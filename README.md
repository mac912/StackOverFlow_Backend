# StackOverFlow_Backend
# Community API Spec

## Running API tests locally

To locally run the provided Postman collection against your backend, execute:

```
POST=3000 npm start
```


## Considerations for your backend with [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

If the backend is about to run on a different host/port than the frontend, make sure to handle `OPTIONS` too and return correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` (e.g. `Content-Type`).

### Authentication Header:

Add the jwt token in the Header (POSTMAN)

`Authorization: Token jwt.token.here`

## JSON Objects returned by API:

Make sure the right content type like `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` is correctly returned.


#### Other status codes:

401 for Unauthorized requests, when a request requires authentication but it isn't provided

403 for Forbidden requests, when a request may be valid but the user doesn't have permissions to perform the action

404 for Not found requests, when a resource can't be found to fulfill the request
